Monads-in-Scala
===============

Example code from a talk I gave for some workmates


The project takes the form of some code snippets that show how you might independently arrive at the concepts behind Monads. In the src folder you'll find the following packages:

- monadsTalk => contains the snippets
- impls => contains any plumbing I put together to keep the examples short and simple.

The code sippets were arranged to (hopefully) build on each other in complexity, and so should probably be read in the following order:

1. Options
2. Lists
3. Futures
4. Config
5. Connections
6. Logger
7. Logger2
